# Hands---Gesture---Recognition

DEMO :: https://youtu.be/yq6pG16Ycx4

Project Overview

Hand gesture recognition system is used for interfacing between computer and human
using hand gesture. We are going to implement a system that recognizes Gesture input
using webcam &amp; performs the Specified Operation.

Problem and Solution Statement

This is very useful for a hands-free approach.Â It is useful in media player. A simple gesture
could pause or play the movie or increase the volume even while sitting afar from the
computer screen.

Benchmark (How this solution is better?)

It follows hand free approach. So, one can easily control this from long distance.

Implementation strategy

We are going to implement a system that recognizes Gesture input using webcam &amp;
performs the Specified Operation. For taking input from webcam we use OPENCV in
python. Then we are going to implement neural network in python for recognizing the web-
Cam input and initialize some specific task to this input.
